Imagine you’ve just collected survey data using an existing multi-item scale (like the Academic Motivation Scale). Based on your goals and what you know about your scale:

\

1.  Which type of factor analysis should will you use — Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) or Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)? Or both?

\
\
\

2.  Clearly justify your choice: Are you exploring an unknown structure, or testing a theory-based structure?

\
\
\
\

3.  What are the key steps you would follow in your chosen analysis? Describe how you would prepare your data (e.g., ordinal items → polychoric correlations, missing data handling, etc.)

\
\
\

4.  State how many factors you expect (and why), or how you’d determine that (e.g., parallel analysis, theoretical basis).

\
\
\

5.  Explain how you would interpret the factor loadings — what values are acceptable, what would raise concern?

\
\
\

6.  Explain how factor analysis is different than clustering analysis. When would you choose to do one over the other?
