# Structure Discovery
Welcome to Structure Discovery, where we explore the foundations of unsupervised machine learning with a focus on discovering patterns in educational data without labels.

Structure Discovery focuses on how we can use unsupervised machine learning to uncover hidden patterns, groupings, and structures within complex educational datasets, without relying on predefined labels or outcomes. In this workshop, we will go through 6 modules where participants will gain both a conceptual foundation and practical experience with key unsupervised learning techniques that are widely used in learning analytics and educational research.

By the end of this course, fellows will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental differences between different unsupervised learning methods
2. Identify scenarios where unsupervised learning is appropriate for educational data
3. Apply basic and advanced clustering techniques to real-world student data
4. Reflect on the ethical, practical, and pedagogical implications of structure discovery
5. Connect unsupervised learning approaches to your teaching or research practice

# Module-1: Introduction  
* [Conceptual Overview](http://localhost:6695/#/title-slide): A slide-based overview introducing the core concepts of structure discovery. This includes key distinctions from supervised learning, common techniques (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and examples of real-world applications.
* [Case Study/Essential Reading](https://github.com/laser-institute/UNsupervised-machine-learning/blob/master/Module-1-Intro/lit/Rahman%20et%20al.%20(2024)%20Case%20Review.pdf): This research article demonstrates the application of unsupervised methods (e.g., clustering) in an educational context.
    üîç Suggested use: Students can annotate the reading, identify methods used, and reflect on findings in small group discussions.

* [Code Along](https://laserkt.quarto.pub/unsupervised-learning-activity---student-performance-with-assistments-b0d3/): A guided coding activity using a real-world dataset. Students apply multiple structure discovery algorithms (e.g., k-means) and interpret results related to student performance.
  üß† Tip: Ideal for hands-on learning following the conceptual overview. We will encourage experimentation with different algorithms (e.g., cluster vs. factor analysis).
  
* [Badge Activity](https://laserkt.quarto.pub/module-1-badge-discovering-patterns-without-labels-03e7/): A self-paced, reflection activity that promotes a deeper understanding of structure discovery methods.
