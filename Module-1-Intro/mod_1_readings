# Structure Discovery
The overall objectives are to introduce you to learning analytics and the different purposes of learning analytics in educational research across different STEM topics.
An important area we will focus on is structure discovery. Once you have read through this chapter [@baker2014learning], especially upon gaining an understanding of structured discovery in relation to other approaches (e.g., relation mining), reflect on the questions presented below:

1) How might structure discovery be useful in your own research and/or teaching practice compared to other approaches? Please compare structure discovery to 1 other learning analytics approach.
2) Select 1 approach in structure discovery discussed in [@baker2014learning]'s chapter and reflect on whether it would be relevant and/or helpful for answering questions you have in research and/or practice.
