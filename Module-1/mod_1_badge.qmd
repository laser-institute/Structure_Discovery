## Discovering Patterns Without Labels

Please write a short essay in response to the following question. How could you apply unsupervised machine learning to solve (just one) real problem in your research or in practice?

Imagine you're a teacher in a classroom with 100 students. Each student has taken multiple assessments, participated in discussions, and completed projects. You notice some students excel in certain tasks but struggle in others.

Without prior labels or categories, how might you group students to better tailor your teaching strategies?

What kind of data might you collect? How would grouping (clustering) these students help you as a teacher? What challenges might arise without predefined labels?

How can unsupervised machine learning help educators make decisions?

What risks or ethical considerations exist (e.g., misinterpreted groupings)?
