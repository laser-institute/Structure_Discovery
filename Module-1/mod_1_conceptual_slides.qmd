## Welcome

Welcome to the **LASER Institute**!

- This module introduces structure discovery in learning analytics.
- Let’s explore key techniques and tools.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Define structure discovery in the context of learning analytics.
- Identify methods such as clustering and factor analysis.
- Apply structure discovery to educational data.

## Structure Discovery

-   A framework in unsupervised machine learning where, in contrast to supervised learning, algorithms learn patterns exclusively from **unlabeled data**.

<!-- -->

-   These models explore the data to discover hidden patterns, structures, and relationships on their own. 

<!-- -->

-   Other frameworks include weak- or semi-supervision, and a small portion are considered self-supervision (but many scientists consider this unsupervised learning).

## Why Unsupervised Learning?

-   Discover hidden structures or data groupings

<!-- -->

-   Ideal for exploratory data analysis

<!-- -->

-   Data preparation for supervised learning:


## Clustering

-   Data mining technique used to form groupings

## Factor Analysis

-   Dimension reduction when we have lots of variables

## Q-Matrix

-   Knowledge inference

-   Skill-item mapping or knowledge component (KC) models

## This week

-   We will go in-depth on clustering, factor analysis, and Q-matrix methods

<!-- -->

-   How to use them to discover insights from data

-   How to avoid obtaining meaningless findings

<!-- -->

-   We will cover examples of each of these three forms of unsupervised learning

## What applications are you interested in?

-   Who here has already used clustering, factor analysis, or Q-Matrix (or something like it)?

-   Tell us more – about the data, about the goal of your analysis

## First Up
