## Unsupervised Learning

-   A framework in machine learning where, in contrast to supervised learning, algorithms learn patterns exclusively from **unlabeled data**.

<!-- -->

-   Other frameworks include weak- or semi-supervision, and a small portion are considered self-supervision (but many scientists consider this unsupervised learning).

## Why Unsupervised Learning?

-   Discover hidden structures or data groupings

<!-- -->

-   Ideal for exploratory data analysis

## Clustering

-   Data mining technique used to form groupings

## Factor Analysis

-   Dimension reduction when we have lots of variables

## Q-Matrix

-   Knowledge inference

-   Skill-item mapping or knowledge component (KC) models

## This week

-   We will go in depth on clustering, factor analysis, and Q-matrix methods

<!-- -->

-   How to use them to discover insights from data

-   How to avoid obtaining meaningless findings

<!-- -->

-   We will cover examples of each of these three forms of unsupervised learning

## What applications are you interested in?

-   Who here has already used clustering, factor analysis, or Q-Matrix (or something like it)?
