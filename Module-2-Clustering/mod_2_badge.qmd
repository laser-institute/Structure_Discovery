Scenario: You are an educator for an introductory course with 50 students. During the course, you collect information on how often and how long students engage with the instructional materials posted on the learning management system.

The data include: Frequency of engagement: How often students access videos, quizzes, and lecture notes. Time spent: Total time students spend interacting with each type of material.

You decide to use k-means clustering to analyze these data to better understand how students engage with the course materials and to design targeted interventions for different student groups. Write a short essay (300â€“500 words) reflecting on the following prompts: What kinds of patterns or groupings might clustering reveal about student behavior or performance in this course?

How could these clusters help you understand differences in how students engage with the course materials?

Are there any specific challenges you anticipate in interpreting these clusters?
