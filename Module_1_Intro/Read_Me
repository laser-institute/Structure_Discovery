Module 1 Structure Discovery Introduction

The overall objective of module 1 is to introduce you to structure discovery, an approach used in learning analytics. To kick us off, I ask that you review the chapter reading provided by Baker and Siemen (2014).
Read about the different purposes of learning analytics in educational research across different STEM topics. An important area we will focus on is structure discovery. 
Once you have read through this chapter and feel you have gained an understanding of structured discovery in relation to other approaches (e.g., relation mining), reflect on the questions presented below:

1) How might structure discovery be useful in your own research and/or teaching practice compared to other approaches? Please compare structure discovery to 1 other learning analytics approach.
2) Select 1 approach in structure discovery discussed in [@baker2014learning]'s chapter and reflect on whether it would be relevant and/or helpful for answering questions you have in research and/or practice.
